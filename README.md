# Arch Linux: Installer and setup

Arch Linux is a great distro, but I spend a lot of time installing and setting
up with my preferences then here are some scripts for execute all of this stuff
or understand how the Arch Linux works.

---

## Steps

### 1.1 Create your bootloader USB to boot with Arch Linux.

[Arch Linux official documentation.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media)

- This project has a script to
  [create a USB flash installation media](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airvzxf/archLinux-installer-and-setup/master/src/laptop_MSI_GT73EVR_7R_Titan_Pro/01-bootable-usb/bootable-usb.sh)

Or

- Download the Arch Linux image.<br>
  [The official server](http://mirror.rackspace.com/archlinux/iso/latest/)<br>
  [Download from the official site](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)<br>

- Create the bootable USB in GNU/Linux
    - Use this command where sdx is your USB device, to find what is this, run
      sudo fdisk -l and try to search your USB and the device name. Your USB
      must be formatted to FAT32.<br>
      Warning: This will irrevocably destroy all data on /dev/sdx.<br>

```sh
sudo fdisk -l
sudo cfdisk /dev/sd[x]
# Delete all the partitions.
# Select: New -> Partition size [enter] -> Primary -> Enable "Bootable" -> Type -> "b W95 FAT32" -> Write -> yes -> Quite
sudo dd bs=4M if=[path_file_archlinux.iso] of=/dev/sd[x] status=progress && sync


```

### 1.2 If you want to create a custom bootloader USB installing git or another packages you are able to run my scripts.

1. Create the ISO file based in our setup.

```sh
# You are able to change the directory where the archiso should be create.
# And the packages which you are looking.

# Execute the scripts
./custom-bootable-usb.sh


```

2. Create the USB bootable based on your custom Arch Linux ISO.

```sh
# You are able to change the directory where the ISO should be find.

# Execute the scripts
./custom-bootable-usb-creating-usb.sh


```

### 2. Init

Reboot your computer with your bootloader USB plugged in your computer and init
the system with the USB.

1. Select the first option which is "Arch Linux archiso x86_64 UEFI CD".

2. Wait for the login session, if it requires a user you can write root and
   press [enter].

3. Connect to internet.
    - If your computer is not connected with ethernet wire you need to setup
      the wifi with this command.

```sh
# Select your network and write your password.
sudo wifi-menu


```

4. Download the "init script" to start this journey.<br>
   This script helps to download the archLinux project in your computer to
   proceed with the installation.<br>

Before run the script change the name and e-mail variables in the 'init.sh'
file.

```sh
cd ~/

# This is the MSI short link
curl -L https://goo.gl/vkE1DS > init.sh

# For MSI Laptop
#curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airvzxf/archLinux-installer-and-setup/master/src/laptop_ASUS_K46CB/02-init/init.sh > init.sh

# For ASUS Laptop
#curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airvzxf/archLinux-installer-and-setup/master/src/laptop_MSI_GT73EVR_7R_Titan_Pro/02-init/init.sh > init.sh

# Change your name and e-mail from the init.sh file executing the nano command.
