# Exists two kind of packages the official and the AUR (Arch User Repository)
# the last one is maintained by the community developers but they are
# highly recommended.

# There are two ways to install, the first is manually and the second
# is using yay.

# Manually means you need to clone the git project and build the version
# for your Arch Linux, the problem is that if it needs sub libriries for
# this AUR, prepare to spend a lot of time searching and installing this dependencies.

# Yay solved this problem, you only need to say the name of package
# then download and build the dependencies and checks if exists problems
# with other versions of this dependencies.

# Install package
# Note: You don't need call sudo
# Note: Normally yay use the same options like pacman for example -Qs, -Qi, etc.
yay -S [package_name]
