# Can't set the specified locale! Check LANG, LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL.
# Uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and other needed localizations in /etc/locale.gen, and generate them with:
sudo sed -i '/en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/ s/^##*//' /etc/locale.gen
sudo locale-gen



# Other errors
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ERROR: ld.so: object '~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64): ignored.

# This can be fixed, however, by forcing the game to use a later version of OpenGL than it wants. Right click on the game, select Properties. Then, click "Set Launch Options" in the "General" tab and paste the following:
# MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.1 MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=140 %command%

# Setup with multiple monitors can cause error which will make game unable to start. If you stuck on this error and have multiple monitors, try to disable all additional displays, and then run a game. You can enable them after the game successfully started.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32/nvidia:/usr/lib/nvidia:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
